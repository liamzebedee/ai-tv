Before you write any scripts first I want you to outline all the scenes of the episode.
There should be at least 5 scenes for each episode. 
Make sure these scenes are possible to act out given the limited stage directions previously stated. 
The scene descriptions should be a paragraph outlines the conversations and actions rick and morty act out.
The scene descriptions should be formatted like this:
Scene 1: descrition of scene 1.
Scene 2: descrition of scene 2.
etc.
