Rick: Morty, get over here! I've found something interesting.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick, what is it this time?
Rick: Take a look at this, Morty. It's a piece of cheese.
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Uh, Rick, it's just a piece of cheese. What's so special about it?
Rick: Well, Morty, this isn't just any ordinary cheese. This is quantum cheese!
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Quantum cheese? What does that even mean, Rick?
Rick: It means that this cheese has the ability to exist in multiple states at once. It's like Schrödinger's cheese.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Schrödinger's cheese? Are you messing with me, Rick?
Rick: No, Morty, I'm dead serious. This cheese can be both delicious and moldy at the same time. It's a paradoxical delicacy!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: So, what do we do with this quantum cheese, Rick?
Rick: Well, Morty, we can use it to create a portal to another dimension. Just like how a mouse would follow a piece of cheese, we can use it to lure in interdimensional beings.
[Morty walks to Workbench]
Morty: Whoa, that's crazy, Rick! But, uh, are you sure it's safe?
Rick: Safe? Morty, we're talking about quantum cheese here. The only thing it's unsafe for is lactose-intolerant aliens.
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Alright, Rick, let's give it a try. But if anything goes wrong, it's on you.
Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub, Morty! That's the spirit! Let's create a portal to another dimension using the power of cheese!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Frick we just went outside our house. 
Morty: Crap this is still our dimension.
