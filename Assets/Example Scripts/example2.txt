Rick: Hey Morty, get your butt in here!
[Morty walks to Rick]
Morty: Aww jeez Rick, what is it now?
Rick: I've been thinking, Morty. We need to settle this once and for all. Which starter Pokémon is the best?
Morty: Are you serious, Rick? We've been through this. Charmander is obviously the best!
Rick: Ha! Charmander? More like Charman-derp! Squirtle is the way to go. Water beats fire every time!
Morty: No way, Rick! Charizard can roast that Squirtle into a turtle soup!
Rick: Fine, Morty. Let's put it to the test. We'll head to the yard and have a Pokémon battle!
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Yard]
Rick: Alright, Morty. I choose you, Squirtle!
[Morty walks to Center Stage]
Morty: Well, I choose you, Charmander!
Rick: You are fricked Morty. Squirtle use Water Gun!
Morty: No, Charmander.
Rick: Ha! Its super effective.
[Rick and Morty enter the portal to the Garage]
Rick: Well, Morty, it looks like my Squirtle had the upper hand!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. I don't know how you did it, but you cheated!
Rick: Cheated? Morty, I'm a genius! I outsmarted you fair and square.
Morty: Whatever, Rick. It's just a stupid Pokémon battle anyway.
Rick: Hey, don't dismiss Pokémon battles, Morty. They're a classic example of simulated combat training.
Morty: Simulated combat training? You mean like the time you turned me into a pickle to fight rats?
Rick: Exactly, Morty! That's what I'm talking about. Wubba lubba dub dub!
Morty: Aww jeez, Rick. Can't we just do something normal for once?
Rick: Normal? Morty, we're far beyond normal. We're adventurers, exploring the infinite possibilities of the multiverse!
Morty: Yeah, yeah, I know, Rick. But sometimes I just want to relax and watch TV.
Rick: Well, Morty, there's always time for TV. But remember, adventure awaits us.
